- Plan details (name, description, pricing)
- Monthly credit allocation
- Credit costs per action
- Export quality
- Features list

### 2. `/api/credits` (GET)
Retrieves user's current credit balance and usage:
- Current available credits
- Total allocated credits for current cycle
- Next refresh date
- Recent transactions

### 3. `/api/credits/spend` (POST)

- Logs upgrade transaction

## Frontend Implementation

### Pricing Page Features
- **Dual Currency Support**: Toggle between USD and INR pricing
- **Billing Interval Toggle**: Switch between monthly and yearly plans
- **Credit Cost Display**: Shows credit costs per action for each plan
- **Export Quality Indicators**: Clear display of video export quality
- **Savings Indicators**: Highlights savings for yearly plans
- **Credit System Explanation**: Educational section about how credits work
- **FAQ Section**: Answers common questions about credit system

### Key UI Components
- Interactive billing toggles (Monthly/Yearly, USD/INR)
- Credit cost breakdown per plan
- Popular plan highlighting
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Clear call-to-action buttons

## Credit System Logic

### Credit Allocation
- Credits are allocated monthly based on subscription plan
- Yearly plans receive bonus credits and lower per-action costs
- Credits refresh on the user's billing cycle date

### Credit Usage
- Each action (idea, script, video, etc.) deducts specific credits
- Credit costs vary by plan tier (higher tiers have lower costs)
- Insufficient credits prevent action execution

### Plan Upgrades
- Remaining credits carry over when upgrading plans
- Billing date updates to current date upon upgrade
- New credit allocation calculated based on new plan
- Downgrade restrictions can be implemented as needed

### Transaction Logging
- All credit transactions are logged for audit purposes
- Includes balance before/after each transaction
- Tracks action types and descriptions
- Enables usage analytics and billing reconciliation

## Benefits of Credit System

1. **Pay-per-Use Model**: Users only pay for what they actually use
2. **Flexible Consumption**: Different actions have appropriate credit costs
3. **Upgrade Incentives**: Higher tiers offer better credit efficiency
4. **Transparent Pricing**: Clear understanding of costs per action
5. **Usage Control**: Built-in spending limits prevent overuse
6. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new actions and adjust costs

## Technical Implementation

### Database Migrations
- Applied schema changes using Drizzle ORM
- Created migration scripts for safe production deployment
- **Legacy Field Cleanup**: Removed redundant `price` field from plans table
- Database schema now uses only `price_usd` and `price_inr` fields for clean dual-currency support

### API Architecture
- RESTful endpoints for credit management
- Proper error handling and validation
- Transaction safety for credit operations
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Frontend Integration
- Real-time credit balance updates
- Responsive pricing display
- Smooth user experience with loading states
- Error handling for insufficient credits

## Future Enhancements

1. **Credit Packages**: Allow users to purchase additional credits
2. **Usage Analytics**: Detailed reports on credit consumption
3. **Auto-Upgrade**: Automatic plan upgrades when credits run low
4. **Credit Sharing**: Team plans with shared credit pools
5. **Promotional Credits**: Bonus credits for referrals or events
6. **Credit Expiration**: Implement credit expiration policies
7. **Usage Predictions**: AI-powered usage forecasting

## Testing Completed

✅ Database schema migration successful
✅ **Legacy field cleanup completed** - Removed redundant `price` column
✅ Seed data populated correctly without legacy fields
✅ API endpoints returning proper data with clean schema
✅ Frontend pricing page displaying correctly
✅ Currency toggle (USD/INR) working
✅ Billing interval toggle (Monthly/Yearly) working
✅ Credit costs displaying per plan
✅ Responsive design verified
✅ All plan tiers showing correct information
✅ **Database schema fully optimized** - No redundant fields

## Schema Cleanup Summary

**Issue Resolved**: The original implementation had a redundant `price` field alongside the new `price_usd` and `price_inr` fields.

**Root Cause**: The migration only added new fields but didn't remove the legacy `price` field, causing NOT NULL constraint violations during seeding.

**Solution Applied**:
1. Created migration to drop legacy `price` and `currency` columns
2. Updated all seed files to remove references to legacy fields
3. Verified API endpoints work correctly with clean schema
4. Confirmed frontend displays proper dual-currency pricing

**Result**: Clean, optimized database schema with no redundant fields and proper dual-currency support.

The credit-based subscription system is now fully implemented and ready for production use.
